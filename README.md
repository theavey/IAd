This is a set of Wolfram Mathematica notebooks and csv files that contain data, analysis functions, and export functions for production of my thesis.

The Mathematica documents were made in Mathematica 9.0.0.0 Student Edition.

These data were collected and the code written by Thomas Heavey under the direction of Craig Ogle at UNCC.
